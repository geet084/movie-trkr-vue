## About
This is a Movie Tracker app where users can view popular, upcoming, and top rated movies. The have the option to create a profile where they can then track their favorites. This project is a reimagining of the [original movie tracker](https://github.com/geet084/movie-tracker-app) I did while attending Turing. The goal was to become more familiar with Vue while also exploring using Bootstrap.
